# PRO2
Dedicated to the PRO2 project done with c++

This whole project is a console program that aims to represent the performance of interconnectated processors, all the specifics can be read at "Enunciat".
It is divided in multiple parts:

-"Entrega intermedia": It doesn't have all the required functions implemented, just a check halfway through.

-"Entrega provisional": Almost at the endpoint, it has everything implented but lacks the right documentation.

-"Entrega final": Complete work with everything that's needed.

At all parts the Makefile can be used to create the needed objects and compile the whole program.
